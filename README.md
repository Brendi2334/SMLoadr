# SMLoadr
> A streaming music downloader.


SMLoadr is a program for downloading music from streaming music services.

It is intended for educational and private use only, and **not** as a tool for pirating and distributing music!

Remember that the artists and studios put a lot of work into making music - purchase music to support them.
